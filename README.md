# CapyBara-Twitter-Bot
To run this program, you will need twitter API keys. Create a keys.py and set the keys equal to the following: 
    consumer_key = (consumer key)
    consumer_secret = (consumer secret key)
    access_token = (access token)
    access_token_secret = (access token secret)
    
After setting this, install the module tweepy, datetime, nltk, and vaderSentiment for full functionality.
